                    <p>When I first started programming this website, I was very excited because I thought 
                        I could make anything I want. I didn't realize how much time and effort I would need though, 
                        and that made me really tired. I was given 1 week to complete it, which I thought wasn't enough, 
                        so that's why it looks rushed. When I got my marks back, I looked at what I needed to improve on, 
                        like proper semantic tags, and indentation. This helped me prepare for my other Web Projects. 
                        Overall, I enjoyed making this project.

                    <p>Web Project 2 required more effort than Web Project 1. I had to research lots of information about 
                        Treaty 1, which took up half time I spent on the project. Things that are showcased in my project 
                        include: historic terms, maps, outside promises, and how Treaty 1 is being implemented today. 
                        Not only did I practice my CSS, but I also learned a lot about Treaty 1. Overall, the time I 
                        spent on research was worth it, and I enjoyed making this project.

                    <p>Web Project 3 is an improved version of Web Project 2. It was easier than my other web projects, because 
                        I had a better understanding of CSS styling. Also, I learned about Color Theory, and how I can implement 
                        a good color scheme. I also learned about Typography, like line spacing and proper html organization. I 
                        also made more web pages and organized the sections in their appropriate pages. Overall, I enjoyed making 
                        this project.
